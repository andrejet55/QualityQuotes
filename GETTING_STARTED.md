# Getting Started - Quick Guide

## 5-Minute Setup

### Step 1: Install Dependencies (1 minute)

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd /home/user/QualityQuotes

# Install required packages
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly faker scipy jupyter notebook
```

Or use the requirements file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Launch Jupyter (30 seconds)

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open your browser with the Jupyter interface.

### Step 3: Run the Notebooks (7 minutes)

In Jupyter, open and run each notebook **in order**:

#### Notebook 1: Generate Data (2 min)
1. Open `01_data_generation.ipynb`
2. Click "Cell" â†’ "Run All"
3. Wait for completion (creates `data/` folder with CSV files)
4. You should see: "Data exported successfully!"

#### Notebook 2: Create Visualizations (3 min)
1. Open `02_visualizations.ipynb`
2. Click "Cell" â†’ "Run All"
3. Scroll through to see 10 interactive charts
4. Hover over charts to see details

#### Notebook 3: Extract Insights (2 min)
1. Open `03_insights_report.ipynb`
2. Click "Cell" â†’ "Run All"
3. Read through the 6 key insights
4. Copy recommendations for your report

### Step 4: Use the Results

Your data and visualizations are now ready to use in your report!

## What You'll Get

### After Notebook 1:
```
data/
â”œâ”€â”€ users.csv          (5,000 user profiles)
â”œâ”€â”€ quotes.csv         (40,000+ quote events)
â”œâ”€â”€ interactions.csv   (60,000+ interactions)
â””â”€â”€ sessions.csv       (25,000+ sessions)
```

### After Notebook 2:
- 10 interactive Plotly charts you can export
- Statistical summaries for each visualization
- Brand-colored, presentation-ready graphics

### After Notebook 3:
- 6 actionable insights with recommendations
- Quantified growth opportunities
- Strategic action plan (immediate/short/long-term)

## Export Charts for Your Report

### Option 1: Save as PNG (Static Image)

```python
# Add this to any cell in notebook 02
fig.write_image("category_performance.png", width=1200, height=600)
```

**Note**: Requires `kaleido` package:
```bash
pip install kaleido
```

### Option 2: Save as HTML (Interactive)

```python
# Add this to any cell in notebook 02
fig.write_html("category_performance.html")
```

Then open the HTML file in your browser and take screenshots.

### Option 3: Screenshot Directly

1. Run the visualization cell
2. Hover to remove any tooltips
3. Use your OS screenshot tool
4. Paste into your report

## Common Questions

### Q: Do I need to modify the code?

**A**: No! Just run the notebooks as-is. Everything is pre-configured with sensible defaults.

### Q: Can I change the number of users or time period?

**A**: Yes! In `01_data_generation.ipynb`, modify these variables:

```python
NUM_USERS = 5000  # Change to 10000 for more data
START_DATE = datetime(2025, 7, 1)  # Change dates as needed
END_DATE = datetime(2025, 9, 30)
```

Then re-run all three notebooks.

### Q: How do I export the entire notebook as PDF?

**A**: In Jupyter, go to File â†’ Download as â†’ PDF via LaTeX (requires LaTeX installation)

Or use command line:
```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to pdf 03_insights_report.ipynb
```

### Q: The charts aren't showing up!

**A**: Try these:
1. Restart the kernel: Kernel â†’ Restart & Run All
2. Make sure Plotly is installed: `pip install plotly --upgrade`
3. Check browser console for errors (F12)

### Q: Can I run this without Jupyter?

**A**: Yes, but Jupyter is recommended. You could convert to Python scripts:
```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to script 01_data_generation.ipynb
python 01_data_generation.py
```

## Tips for Your Report

### 1. Methodology Section

Copy from `workflow_diagram.md`:
- "Data Generation Strategy" section
- "Statistical Distributions Used"
- "Technical Challenges & Solutions"

### 2. Results Section

Use visualizations from notebook 02:
- Export 4-5 key charts as images
- Include chart titles and captions
- Reference specific findings

### 3. Insights Section

Copy from notebook 03:
- Each of the 6 insights
- Supporting statistics
- Recommendations

### 4. Discussion Section

Use from `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`:
- "Why This Stack?" rationale
- "What Makes This Implementation Strong"
- Technical design decisions

### 5. Conclusion

Use from notebook 03:
- Strategic recommendations summary
- Success metrics
- Next steps

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'plotly'"

**Fix**: Install missing package
```bash
pip install plotly
```

### Error: "FileNotFoundError: data/users.csv"

**Fix**: Run notebook 01 first to generate data files

### Error: "Kernel died"

**Fix**: You may have too many users. Reduce `NUM_USERS` to 2000 in notebook 01

### Charts show but no interactivity

**Fix**: Make sure you're viewing in Jupyter, not a static export
